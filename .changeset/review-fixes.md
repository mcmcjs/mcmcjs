Harden the package-pin and matrix features from review: reject version strings that could inject Julia code (only safe version-spec characters allowed), make mcmc fit --versions honor a spec's package pins and record file-data references per version, reject --versions with --package-versions together, fail fast on unmanaged/unsafe pins, isolate juliaup under HOME in --strict sandboxes, and stop leaking the resolved dataFilePath into exported specs.
